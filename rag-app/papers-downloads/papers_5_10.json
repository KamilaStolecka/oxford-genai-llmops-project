[{"title": "Electron-Electron Bremsstrahlung Emission and the Inference of Electron\n  Flux Spectra in Solar Flares", "summary": "Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute to\nthe hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such\nan omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\\sim 300$\nkeV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in\ngeneral makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray\nspectrum steeper at high energies.\n  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot\nproduce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The\nmaximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of\nthe emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic\nfor an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated\nelectrons.\n  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show\nthat the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is\nnaturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.\nIndeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized\ninversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both\nelectron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral\nindex $\\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E\n= 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron\nspectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy\nexists."}, {"title": "Improved scenario of baryogenesis", "summary": "It is assumed that, in the primordial plasma, at the temperatures above the\nmass of electron, fermions are in the neutral state being the superposition of\nparticle and antiparticle.

Variational Diagrammatic Quantum\nMonte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used\nto quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electron\ninteraction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous\nDiffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the\neffective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional\nelectron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field\nfactors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the\nelectron gas at metallic densities.\n  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. At\nthe compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)\nterm and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron\ninteraction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to large\ncancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than\neither term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to the\nelectron-electron interaction becomes an important factor. The static\nelectron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density but is less\nrepulsive for electrons with parallel spins.\n  The effect of allowing a deformable, rather than rigid, positive background\nis shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation. As a\nsimple concrete example, the electron-electron interaction is calculated using\nthe measured bulk modulus of the alkali metals with a linear phonon dispersion.\nThe net electron-electron interaction in lithium is attractive for wave vectors\n$0-2k_F$, which suggests superconductivity, and is mostly repulsive for the\nother alkali metals."}, {"title": "Electron-electron interactions in a weakly screened two-dimensional\n  electron system", "summary": "We probe the strength of electron-electron interactions using\nmagnetoconductivity measurements of two-dimensional non-degenerate electrons on\nliquid helium at 1.22 K.

In semiconductors,\nthese phenomena have been so far studied in relatively weak electron-electron\ninteraction regimes, where the single electron picture holds. However, SOC can\nprofoundly compete against Coulomb interaction, which could lead to the\nemergence of unconventional electronic phases. Since SOC depends on the\nelectric field in the crystal including contributions of itinerant electrons,\nelectron-electron interactions can modify this coupling. Here we demonstrate\nthe emergence of SOC effect in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system\nin a simple band structure MgZnO/ZnO semiconductor. This electron system\nfeatures also strong electron-electron interaction effects. By changing the\ncarrier density with Mg-content, we tune the SOC strength and achieve its\ninterplay with electron-electron interaction. These systems pave a way to\nemergent spintronic phenomena in strong electron correlation regime and to the\nformation of novel quasiparticles with the electron spin strongly coupled to\nthe density."}, {"title": "Free-electron properties of metals under ultrafast laser-induced\n  electron-phonon nonequilibrium: A first-principles study", "summary": "The electronic behavior of various solid metals (Al, Ni, Cu, Au, Ti, and W)\nunder ultrashort laser irradiation is investigated by means of density\nfunctional theory. Successive stages of extreme nonequilibrium on picosecond\ntime scale impact the excited material properties in terms of optical coupling\nand transport characteristics. As these are generally modelled based on the\nfree-electron classical theory, the free-electron number is a key parameter.\nHowever, this parameter remains unclearly defined and dependencies on the\nelectronic temperature are not considered. Here, from first-principles\ncalculations, density of states are obtained with respect to electronic\ntemperatures varying from 10^-2 to 10^5 K within a cold lattice. Based on the\nconcept of localized or delocalized electronic states, temperature dependent\nfree-electron numbers are evaluated for a series of metals covering a large\nrange of electronic configurations. With the increase of the electronic\ntemperature we observe strong adjustments of the electronic structures of\ntransition metals. These are related to variations of electronic occupation in\nlocalized d bands, via change in electronic screening and electron-ion\neffective potential. The electronic temperature dependence of nonequilibrium\ndensity of states has consequences on electronic chemical potentials,\nfree-electron numbers, electronic heat capacities, and electronic pressures.\nThus electronic thermodynamic properties are computed and discussed, serving as\na base to derive energetic and transport properties allowing the description of\nexcitation and relaxation phenomena caused by rapid laser action."}, {"title": "First-principles calculations of hot-electron lifetimes in metals", "summary": "First-principles calculations of the inelastic lifetime of low-energy\nelectrons in Al, Mg, Be, and Cu are reported.

Inelastic lifetimes are then\nobtained along various directions of the electron wave vector, with full\ninclusion of the band structure of the solid. Average lifetimes are also\nreported, as a function of the electron energy. In Al and Mg, splitting of the\nband structure over the Fermi level yields electron lifetimes that are smaller\nthan those of electrons in a free-electron gas. Larger lifetimes are found in\nBe, as a result of the characteristic dip that this material presents in the\ndensity of states near the Fermi level.

The D'yakonov-Perel'\nspin relaxation of electrons in these materials is controlled by electron-hole\nscattering, with small corrections from electron-electron scattering and\nvirtually none from electron-impurity scattering. We derive simple expressions\n(one-dimensional and two-dimensional integrals respectively) for the effective\nelectron-hole and electron-electron scattering rates which enter the spin\nrelaxation time calculation. The electron-hole scattering rate is found to be\ncomparable to the scattering rates from impurities in the electron liquid - a\ncommon model for n-type doped semiconductors. As the density of electron-hole\npairs decreases (within the degenerate regime), a strong enhancement of the\nscattering rates and a corresponding slowing down of spin relaxation is\npredicted due to exchange and correlation effects in the electron-hole liquid.\nIn the opposite limit of high density, the original D'yakonov-Perel' model\nfails due to decreasing scattering rates and is eventually superseded by free\nprecession of individual quasiparticle spins."}, {"title": "First-principles calculations of heat capacities of ultrafast\n  laser-excited electrons in metals", "summary": "Ultrafast laser excitation can induce fast increases of the electronic\nsubsystem temperature. The subsequent electronic evolutions in terms of band\nstructure and energy distribution can determine the change of several\nthermodynamic properties, including one essential for energy deposition; the\nelectronic heat capacity. Using density functional calculations performed at\nfinite electronic temperatures, the electronic heat capacities dependent on\nelectronic temperatures are obtained for a series of metals, including free\nelectron like, transition and noble metals. The effect of exchange and\ncorrelation functionals and the presence of semicore electrons on electronic\nheat capacities are first evaluated and found to be negligible in most cases.\nThen, we tested the validity of the free electron approaches, varying the\nnumber of free electrons per atom. This shows that only simple metals can be\ncorrectly fitted with these approaches. For transition metals, the presence of\nlocalized d electrons produces a strong deviation toward high energies of the\nelectronic heat capacities, implying that more energy is needed to thermally\nexcite them, compared to free sp electrons. This is attributed to collective\nexcitation effects strengthened by a change of the electronic screening at high\ntemperature."}, {"title": "Born-Oppenheimer Dynamics, Electronic Friction, and the Inclusion of\n  Electron-Electron Interactions", "summary": "We present a universal expression for the electronic friction as felt by a\nset of classical nuclear degrees of freedom (DoF's) coupled to a manifold of\nquantum electronic DoF's; no assumptions are made regarding the nature of the\nelectronic Hamiltonian and electron-electron repulsions are allowed. Our\nderivation is based on a quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) for the\ncoupled electronic-nuclear motion, followed by an adiabatic approximation\nwhereby electronic transitions are assumed to equilibrate faster than nuclear\nmovement. The resulting form of friction is completely general, but does reduce\nto previously published expressions for the quadratic Hamiltonian (i.e.\nHamiltonians without electronic correlation). At equilibrium, the second\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied and the frictional matrix is\nsymmetric. To demonstrate the importance of electron-electron correlation, we\nstudy electronic friction within the Anderson-Holstein model, where a proper\ntreatment of electron-electron interactions shows signatures of a Kondo\nresonance and a mean-field treatment is completely inadequate."}, {"title": "Emergence and spectral-weight transfer of electronic states in the\n  Hubbard ladder", "summary": "The number of electronic bands is usually considered invariant regardless of\nthe electron density in a band picture. However, in interacting systems, the\nspectral-weight distribution generally changes depending on the electron\ndensity, and electronic states can even emerge or disappear as the electron\ndensity changes.

A mode\nemerging in the low-electron-density limit gains spectral weight as the\nelectron density increases and governs the dimer Mott physics at\nquarter-filling. In contrast, the antibonding band, which is dominant in the\nlow-electron-density regime, loses spectral weight and disappears at the Mott\ntransition at half-filling, exhibiting the momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion\nrelation in the small-doping limit.
