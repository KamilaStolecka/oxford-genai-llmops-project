Our\nderivation is based on a quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) for the\ncoupled electronic-nuclear motion, followed by an adiabatic approximation\nwhereby electronic transitions are assumed to equilibrate faster than nuclear\nmovement. The resulting form of friction is completely general, but does reduce\nto previously published expressions for the quadratic Hamiltonian (i.e.\nHamiltonians without electronic correlation). At equilibrium, the second\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied and the frictional matrix is\nsymmetric. To demonstrate the importance of electron-electron correlation, we\nstudy electronic friction within the Anderson-Holstein model, where a proper\ntreatment of electron-electron interactions shows signatures of a Kondo\nresonance and a mean-field treatment is completely inadequate."}, {"title": "Emergence and spectral-weight transfer of electronic states in the\n  Hubbard ladder", "summary": "The number of electronic bands is usually considered invariant regardless of\nthe electron density in a band picture. However, in interacting systems, the\nspectral-weight distribution generally changes depending on the electron\ndensity, and electronic states can even emerge or disappear as the electron\ndensity changes. Here, to clarify how electronic states emerge and become\ndominant as the electron density changes, the spectral function of the Hubbard\nladder with strong repulsion and strong intrarung hopping is studied using the\nnon-Abelian dynamical density-matrix renormalization-group method. A mode\nemerging in the low-electron-density limit gains spectral weight as the\nelectron density increases and governs the dimer Mott physics at\nquarter-filling. In contrast, the antibonding band, which is dominant in the\nlow-electron-density regime, loses spectral weight and disappears at the Mott\ntransition at half-filling, exhibiting the momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion\nrelation in the small-doping limit. This paper identifies the origin of the\nelectronic states responsible for the Mott transition and brings a new\nperspective to electronic bands by revealing the overall nature of electronic\nstates over a wide energy and electron-density regime."}, {"title": "Electronic Properties Of Buckminsterfullerenes: Degeneracies and\n  Surprises", "summary": "Buckminsterfullerene compounds exibit remarkable physics at low temperatures,\ne.g. high temperature superconductivity in alkali-fullerenes, and\nferromagnetism in TDAE -C60.

In this paper, the propagation of\nelectron-acoustic solitary waves is investigated in a collisionless,\nunmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background electrons, hot\nsuprathermal electrons (modeled by a $\\kappa$-type distribution), and\nstationary ions. The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A\nlinear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-amplitude wave\nstructures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed on the electron beam\nvelocity and density. A (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to\nobtain the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and investigate\nhow their nonlinear structures depend on the kinematic and physical properties\nof the electron beam and the suprathermality (described by $\\kappa$) of the hot\nelectrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can largely alter the\nelectron-acoustic solitary waves, but can only produce negative polarity\nsolitary waves in this model. While the electron beam co-propagates with the\nsolitary waves, the soliton existence domain (Mach number range) becomes\nnarrower (nearly down to nil) with increasing the beam speed and the\nbeam-to-hot electron temperature ratio, and decreasing the beam-to-cool\nelectron density ratio in high suprathermality (low $\\kappa$).

In this paper, we analyze interaction of a pair of electrons with\nsuch an energy dispersion. We show that relative motion of the electron pair is\nof a very peculiar character. For example, the real space trajectories\ncorresponding to electron-electron scattering can have three reversal points,\nreversal points at non-zero radial momentum and other unusual features. Despite\nthe repulsive Coulomb interaction, two electrons can be coupled forming a\ncomposite quasi-particle - the bi-electron. The bi-electron corresponds to\nexcited states of the two-electron system. Because the bi-electron coupled\nstates exist in continuum of extended (free) states of the electron pair, these\nstates are quasi-resonant and have finite times of life. We found that rotating\nbi-electron is a long-living composite quasi-particle. The rotating\nbi-electrons can be in motion. For slowly moving bi-electrons, we determined\nthe kinetic energy and the effective mass. Due to strongly nonparabolic energy\ndispersion, the translational motion of the bi-electron is coupled to its\ninternal motion. This results in effective masses dependent on quantum states\nof the bi-electron. In the paper, properties of the bi-electron are illustrated\nfor the example of bigraphene in a transverse electric field."}, {"title": "Electron Dynamics at a Positive Ion", "summary": "The dynamics of electrons in the presence of a positive ion is considered for\nconditions of weak electron-electron couping but strong electron-ion coupling.\nThe equilibrium electron density and electric field time correlation functions\nare evaluated for semi-classical conditions using a classical statistical\nmechanics with a regularized electron-ion interaction for MD simulation. The\ntheoretical analysis for the equilibrium state is obtained from the\ncorresponding nonlinear Vlasov equation. Time correlation functions for the\nelectrons are determined from the linearized Vlasov equation. The resulting\nelectron dynamics is described in terms of a distribution of single\nelectron-ion trajectories screened by an inhomogeneous electron gas dielectric\nfunction. The results are applied to calculation of the autocorrelation\nfunction for the electron electric field at the ion for $ 0\\leq Z\\leq 40$,\nincluding conditions of strong electron-ion coupling.

Up to date, only few\nexperiments have been performed in a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas\nwhere the electron propagates almost ballistically. Flying electrons were\ndetected via the current generated by an ensemble of electrons and electron\ncorrelations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the\nexperimental realisation of high efficiency single electron source and single\nelectron detector for a quantum medium where a single electron is propagating\nisolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving\npotential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single\nelectron along the 1D-channel at a speed of 3\\mum/ns.
