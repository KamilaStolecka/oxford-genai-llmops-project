By analogy with the\npseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective\nelectron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the\nscattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero\nelectron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this\nsmooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation.\nWe perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both\nwith the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective\nelectron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of\nthe wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not\nsignificantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction\nfor energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to\npopular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting\nfactor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations."}, {"title": "Electron thermal conductivity owing to collisions between degenerate\n  electrons", "summary": "We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by\nelectron-electron Coulomb scattering in a strongly degenerate electron gas\ntaking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons.

Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field\nfactors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the\nelectron gas at metallic densities.\n  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. At\nthe compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)\nterm and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron\ninteraction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to large\ncancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than\neither term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to the\nelectron-electron interaction becomes an important factor. The static\nelectron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density but is less\nrepulsive for electrons with parallel spins.\n  The effect of allowing a deformable, rather than rigid, positive background\nis shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation.
